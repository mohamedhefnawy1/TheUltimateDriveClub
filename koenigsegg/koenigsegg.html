                <div id="title">What makes it so special?</div>

                <div class="description">This car is special not only because of its story and design, but also for its innovations in technology. The CC850 is the first car in history to have a transmission which can operate in full automatic mode, or act just like a conventional six-speed manual transmission complete with clutch pedal and gorgeous gated shifter. In addition, it was claimed that only 50 units will ever be made and will cost around 4 million dollars each, but after all 50 units were sold out after 5 days of its release, they plan to make 20 more units.
